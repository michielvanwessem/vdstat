TO BE ANNOUNCED
Removed the use of variable "gzip_logs". Considering this behaviour is 
  not used in Slackware anyway. Add to this the overhead in code that
  compressed logs would give, it's just not worth it.
Removed the absurdly long var "logfiles_to_keep". This turned out not 
  to be functional at all and just made things a whole lot more complex
  Replaced by a simple logfiles="xx" where xx is the number of months.
vdshowlog() - Fixed. Showlog wasn't displaying any logfiles more than 
  three months in the past. With logfiles_to_keep gone, and some minor
  code adjustments it should display the ammount of data correct.

Fixed errors in the days date. Occasionally when padding is applied
  vdstat has a problem reading it as an integer and a string.
Fixed vd_main to calculate the totals if we actually rotate the 
 files at 00:00. This was previously ignored.

Upgraded and Released to version 2.5
Added start to support more than one interface. This needs much work.
  For now vdstat supports an interface as the first argument: ie
  vdstat ethX [cmdline args]
vdreport() - Added. vdreport is the reporting module that output total
  and average in weeks/months. Note it only goes back as long as you
  have logfiles. Written by andarius.
vdshowlog() - Added. Implemented a first step to a showlog function:
  vdstat -s will show you the current logfile generated by cron. Written

Upgraded vdstat to version 2.4.
Code cleanup. Removed let VAR=$( .. ) and replaced it with proper
  bash like VAR=$(( .. ))
+--------------------------+
Fri May 16 2008
Upgraded vdstat to version 2.3.
Changed logfile to vdstat.
Code merged with andarius's improvements.
Implemented forced rotating of the logfiles.
Changed the reporting so it containts both a start and end date, as well
  proper spacing for the bigger ammounts of traffic. This requires a forced
  logrotate (vdstat -l).
+--------------------------+
Thu May 15 2008
This file also contains the use of $ROTATE_AT for hour to rotate.
  Written by andarius.
Edited the formatting section to add an additional space to fix
  formatting of values of 10 GB and above.
